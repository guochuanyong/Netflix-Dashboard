## 🔍 Overview

Netflix allows viewers to search for movies and TV shows by content type, production country, or genre. However, there is no ranking system on Netflix. Ranking requires external services such as IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes. This dashboard allows viewers to search for popular Netflix titles ranked by IMDb score, based on user selected content type, production country, and/or genre. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle. Some light data cleaning is performed in Python to prepare the dataset for Tableau.
